# Lokalise API Node Client Changelog

## 5.0.0 (08-Jul-20)

* Added all recently introduced attributes for the following endpoints: `Key` and `File`.
* API now supports only background file uploads, and the `queue` parameter doesn't have any effect anymore. Therefore, removed all code and docs related to sync uploading.
* Parameters required by the API are now enforced by the client as well.
* Updated the `merge` method for the `Branches` endpoint. It now accepts the branch ID to merge, the project ID and the optional list of additional parameters:

```js
lokaliseApi.branches.merge(34567,
  {project_id: '123.abc'},
  {"force_conflict_resolve_using": "master"}
)
```
